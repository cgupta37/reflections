When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would prefer a remote repository when I need to access my project when I don't have my computer with me, or when I need to share my project with someone else.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If Git automatically stays up-to-date with the remote repository, every commit will be pulled. This will result in many unnecessary pulls. However, if I manually pull the changes, I can do so when sufficient number of commits have been made to a branch.
